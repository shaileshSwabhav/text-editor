Note that to allow importing JavaScript files without providing their corresponding 
types you need to set allowJs to true in the tsconfig.json file. Also, make sure that 
you target ES6 or higher, otherwise you are likely to end up with a weird 
transpilation error in the production build.

"compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "target": "es2015"
    // other options
}

If you cannot set the target higher than es5, try to set "buildOptimizer": false 
which will produce a bigger, but correct production build.
